# Command Line Lesson
This lesson introduces the command line/bash as a general idea. The students should gain some familiarity with the tool, and feel comfortable at least moving around directories. They should understand some basics about how commands work.

## Warm Up
Pose the following question to the students:
>How do you think early computers worked? How might they have been different than the computers we use today?

## Lecture
The lecture introduces the idea of the command line, and gets into a few of the most basic commands:
- pwd
- ls
- cd

As part of the lecture, show the commands in action with an actual Git Bash or PowerShell instance.

## More Commands (optional)
The students can research some slightly more advanced commands using the [More Commands](MoreCommands.md) instructions file. For the most part, they should be able to figure them out. There are also some challenges for the students to try. After a time, the instructor should review how each of the commands work.

### Challenge
Instruct students to try the [Terminus game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/).

The game reinforces basic command line concepts, and should increase their overall comfort level with the command line.
