# Final Project
Build a CRUD App using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL.

## Background
Before starting the final project, complete the [CRUD App Walkthrough](../FullCrudApp/CrudAppWalkthrough.md). Feel free to use the final code from the walkthrough as a starting point for the project. However, **the app should keep track of a different type of data**.

## Requirements
A user should be able to:
- **C**reate rows in the database
- **R**ead data from the database
- **U**pdate existing rows in the database
- **D**elete rows from the database

### Implementation
- Store the project in a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
- Create at least one (1) new database table
- Create at least one (1) new page for the application
- Create at least one (1) new route for the application
- Update the styles for the application

## Presentations
Students will present their projects at the last meeting. Presentations should include:
- Background about the idea behind the app
- An overview of the app's functionality
- An explanation of any new topics learned
- A brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code 

## Ideas
This list of ideas is in no way comprehensive; feel free to go beyond and do something completely different!

### Enhancement Ideas
- A message asking "Are you sure you want to delete this object?"
- Custom styles for table rows based on data
- A separate "Information" page for each database object
- Sortable data table
- Images for each database object
- Preventing users from adding duplicates to the database
- A new database table that links to the main table via [foreign key](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-foreign-key/)
