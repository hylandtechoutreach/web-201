# Final Project
The students should have some time to create a final project of their choosing. It can be similar to the [Full CRUD App](../FullCrudApp/) with some updates. They can choose to track whatever type of data they would like.

## Options
Students who do not have much experience can simply update the CRUD app with new types of data and new styles. More advanced students should have the opportunity to expand on the CRUD app, or create something entirely new. The final project is the best time for them to go beyond the course curriculum and explore new topics.

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester. On May 6, 2020, office hours will be from **5-6:30pm** for presentations.

### Content
The presentation should include:

- An overview of the application's functionality
- A look into the architecture/code of the application
- A discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development

### Procedure

- Students should push all of their code to GitHub
    - Make sure the code is shared with the instructors
- If a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred
    - If a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone
    - If a student cannot share their screen, the instructor can show the student's project
- A student also has the option of recording a video presentation
- There will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present
- **If a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club**

## Assessment
The final projects will be the summative assessment for the entire course. Instructors should measure the success of the course by looking at the final projects, and determining how well the students used the knowledge they learned in the course. If the students are able to apply concepts and create satisfactory web apps, the course has achieved its mission.
