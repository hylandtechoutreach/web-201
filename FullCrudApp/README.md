# Full CRUD App
Allow the students to individually work on building CRUD apps by following the [CRUD App Walkthrough](CrudAppWalkthrough.md). During this time, instructors should assist students with any issues they have. It may be beneficial to go over certain sections as a class, but for the most part, the students should be able to work at their own pace.

When the students finish building the CRUD app, they can start on their [Final Projects](../FinalProject/).
