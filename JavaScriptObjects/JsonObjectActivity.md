Have a big object on the board, like:
```js
results = [
    {
        name: 'Alice',
        age: 25,
        contactInfo: {
            phoneNumber: '1234567890'
            emailAddress: 'Alice@alice.com',
            mailingAddress: '123 Fake Street, Faketown USA'
        }
    },
    {
        name: 'Rudiger',
        age: 10,
        contactInfo: {
            phoneNumber: '1115553226'
            emailAddress: 'Person@people.com',
            mailingAddress: '742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield USA'
        }
    },
    {
        name: 'Pat',
        age: 67,
        contactInfo: {
            phoneNumber: '2128702309'
            emailAddress: 'Pat@hotmail.com',
            mailingAddress: '30 Rockerfeller Center, New York USA'
        }
    }
]
```

Go around the room and have students get or set some values.
